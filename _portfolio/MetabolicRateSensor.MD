# Features

* **Novel Concept** A non-invasive transdermal metabolic rate sensor utilizing mid-infrared light.
* **Industry-standard Detection Capability** When optimized, this sensor can detect highly specific changes in the concentration of CO2 present in air.
* **Advancing Technology** Additional tests are yielding an ability to detect changes through liquids introduced to lab-made skin phantoms.
